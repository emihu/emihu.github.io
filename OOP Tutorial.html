    <h2> OOP Tutorial </h2>

    <p> In this tutorial, we are going to cover the basic concepts of OOP (object oriented programming).</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        Green is for those readers who want the most basic introduction. It is targeted at those who are unsure what object-oriented programming is, and could use a good analogy to make things clearer. Yellow is for those who want to be able to understand object-oriented programming just enough to be able to read and follow it, but are not yet ready to learn the intricacies of coding Java. And finally, the third level, red, is for you daredevils who want to be able to program in Java, but just want to ease into it slowly.
        In short, the green text gives a "plain English" version of the code that would be necessary, the yellow uses that English in a way that more closely resembles the format of code, and the red is the actual code that would be necessary for the program to work.
