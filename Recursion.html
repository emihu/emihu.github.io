    <h2> Recursion Tutorial </h2>

    <p> In this tutorial, we are going to cover the concept of recursion.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p style="font-weight:800;margin-bottom:0px;">WHAT IS RECURSION? </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 5px;">
        Recursion is a process where something continuously calls itself, directly or indirectly, until an end condition is met. Thus, a recursive method is a
        method that calls itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        When creating a recursive solution, it is important that the following three main criteria are met: <br />
        -	A way to distinguish and act when the endpoint of the solution is reached <br />
        -	The problem must be able to be reduced into smaller, repetitive elements <br />
        -	A larger result must be achieved through the component elements
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p style="font-weight:800;margin-bottom:0px;">BENEFITS & DRAWBACKS </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 5px;margin-bottom:0px;">
        There are many benefits to using recursion over regular loops. To start off with, it is easier, clearer, shorter and simpler to understand compared to
        non-recursive functions. In addition, the program can present an accurate representation of the abstract solution strategy.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, there are also some drawbacks to using recursion. It may take a longer amount of time as the program has to allocate and release memory, copy
        values to store the parameters into the local memory, and branch to/return from the function. Not to mention, a stack-overflow may occur if an infinite
        loop is created from an end condition that is never met, or if the recursion goes too deep and requires too many steps.

    <p style="font-weight:800;margin-bottom:0px;">EXAMPLES </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 5px;">
        Here are a few examples using recursion. Feel free to play around and test the code yourself!
