    <h2> Arrays & Array Lists Tutorial </h2>

    <p> In this tutorial, we are going to cover how arrays, ArrayLists and multidimensional arrays work.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 5px;">
        An array is a data structure used to implement a list object, where the elements in the list are of the same type. An array
        can be of different types ranging from primative data types to objects. Each element of the array is also given an integer index starting from 0, which
        represents its position. In addition, arrays can be manipulated and used in different ways through loops and array methods such as length. An example of
        an array in action is shown below.

    <p style="margin-top: 5px;">
        An ArrayList is a dynamic type of array that can be found in the java.util package. It is similar to the built-in array and the main difference is its
        ability to be resized. With ArrayList, elements can added and removed very easily. While with regular arrays, another array would have to be created to
        accommodate the changes. However, it's important to note that the syntax differs. An example of an ArrayList in action is shown below.

    <p style="font-weight:800;margin-bottom:0px;">MULTIDIMENSIONAL ARRAYS </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 5px;">
        A multidimensional array is essentially an array of arrays. In this tutorial, only 2D arrays will be discussed. Two dimensional arrays can be thought of
        as a grid with each element having an x and y co-ordinate. In java, this is represented in its index as [row] and [column]. Other than the extra dimension
        to consider, everything else follows the same rules as regular arrays, such as the size cannot be changed. An example of a 2D array in action is shown below.

    <p style="font-weight:800;margin-bottom:0px;">EXAMPLE </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 5px;">
        Ms. Krasteva needs help organizing her student's marks. To help her, I have created a program that takes input from a file of student names and marks, and
        outputs the data in two columns. To ensure that Ms. Krasteva will never have to waste time finding who the worst student in her class is or worrying about
        mixing up her student's marks, I have created three programs. The first one simply outputs the original data in the same order, but formatted into two
        columns. The second program sorts the data alphabetically by name. Finally, the last program sorts the data alphabetically by marks.
    </p>
    <p>
        The way I coded my solution was by first creating two ArrayLists, one to store the name and the other to store the mark. Then, for programs 2 and 3, I used
        a sorting algorithm to sort the arrays according to name/marks. Finally, I outputted the arrays in a table format.
